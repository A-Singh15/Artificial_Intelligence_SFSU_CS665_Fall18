Description:

This project is about reinforcement learning and Q_learning. We will need to implement value iteration and Q-Learning.There are eight questions in this assignment.
The first question is asking about value iteration. A value iteration is an offline planner, not a reinforcement learning agent.The second question is about Bridge Crossing Analysis. All we need to change is that One variable of the Discount and noise parameters in order to support the optimal policy of the agent to attempt to cross the bridge. 
The third question is producing optimal policy types including question a-e which are the preference of close and distant exist,have to decide risking or avoiding the cliff by tuple of (discount, noise, living reward).The fourth question is about Q-Learning. The idea of Q_learning is very useful in the area of where the MDP is available and value iteration agent doesn't learn from experience. We have to implement initialized getQvalue and return with state, action and compute value of Q_value. The fifth question is epsilon greedy.It has to be done by implementing the pick action of the legal action of state using support file called util.flipCoin (which also given as Hint) 
and update New_Qvalue from the old one.The sixth question is default for random Q-learner which need to edit in analysis.py to observe the optimal policy. In this case return NOT POSSIBLE.The seventh question is basically train the pacman to learn values of positions and actions. Training and testing mode can be taken care of quiet mode. The eight question is about approximate Q-Learning. This approximate Q_leanrning agent can learn weights for features of states. 

I discuss the idea and implementation of this assignment with Naylin Min. 
The Total time I spent for this project is more than 18-20 hours. The materials are quite a bit challenging however I enjoyed searching new things.
