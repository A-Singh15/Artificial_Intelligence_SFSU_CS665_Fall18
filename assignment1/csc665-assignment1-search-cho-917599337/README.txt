Description:

There is two part and eight questions on this assignment.
The first question is asking about the Depth-First Search (DFS): Graph search implemented with the data structures of stack. The second one is about the Breadth-First Search (BFS): Graph search implemented with queue. As well Uniform Cost Search (UCS): Graph search is implemented with Priority Queue. A* search Manhattan distance heuristic to find the optimal solution. 
Question1 2 and 3 and 4 are quite similar, the differences are using different data structures from the util.py.
Finding all the corners problems isThe corners problem is based on the A* search in order to find all the corners and I still get hard time implement with that as well as The food search problem are the search problem and heuristic for paceman to eat all dots and the suboptimal search problem which I didn't have to finish up.
I discuss the idea of this assignment with Naylin Min. 
The Total time I spent for this project is more than 20 hours and still need more time to finish up. The materials are quite a bit challenging however I enjoyed searching new things.
