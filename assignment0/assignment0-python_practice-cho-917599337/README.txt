Description:


Question 1 is basically implementing with the basic addition with two variables to get output the values.

Question 2: This problem is simply multiplication of fruits order and price and sum up the total of those multiplication numbers:
	
	Order x Price   
Apple     2       2   = 4
Peach     3      1.75 = 5.25
Lime      4      0.75 = 3 
		      ---------
		total = 12.25

Question 3: The question ask about the least amount in total which means the cheapest fruit shop in general and we compare the list of fruitsShops (ie. Shop1 and shop2) comparing if the orderlist that passed in FruitShop.getPriceOfOrder is greater than the orderlist of cheapest shop that passed in FruitShop.getPriceOfOrder in same way, we get back the cheapest shop is similar with the shop.
